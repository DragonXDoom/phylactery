Tests:
    - TODO: Write tests

- Things be removed after two years or upon request
- Phone + Email on membership forms, address + phone on borrowing form
- Old borrowing records deleted after a year
- Names + borrowing data only for gatekeepers

Admin > Committee > Gatekeeper > everything else

Control Panel:
    - Expire all financial memberships from before [date] (default=1/1/[this year]). (President, VP, Secretary)
    - Gatekeeper Purge (President, VP)
    - Webkeeper Purge (President, VP)
    - Library Overview (OCM+)
    - Replace Committee Member(s) (President, VP)
    - Change website theme (President, VP)

Questions to ask (Membership):
    - What information do you want to store in the Member DB?
    - What information do you want to store on borrowing records?
    - When do you want what information to be deleted?
    - Who do you want to be able to see what information? (For example, should gatekeepers see names of members? Should they see email addresses?)
        - Coming off of that, do you want a way for people to see information that's they shouldn't need to, provided that it's logged?
            (Example: A gatekeeper can get a members phone number to contact them about lost property, but that action will be put in the log)
    -  I aim to have the majority of this finished by O-Day, would you folks be willing to make this the first digital O-Day for the club?

Questions to ask (Library):
    - Barcode field in library data?
    - Current plan for library borrowing is:
        - A Gatekeeper can log in, add items to their 'cart', and then 'checkout'.
        - They'll put in the details of whoever is borrowing them.
        - Items will be borrowed individually, in case someone wants/needs to return an item early.
        - Due dates will be automatically set, keeping in mind any reservation forms in place, high-demand items, and the default time of two-weeks.
        - When a person wants to return items, gatekeeper will log on, check a "library overview page",
            find the member that wants to return things, and tick boxes to say they've returned them.
        - Website will show an items borrowable status, if it is available or not.
        - If not available, it will say the date that you can expect to be returned by, keeping in mind any reservation forms.
    - Would the club consider getting a tablet for library purpose?


Members:
    - DONE: (Members) Make the gatekeeper sign-up/login form work again
    - DONE: (Members) Create membership items
    - DONE: (Members) Make a easy to use member add form, that doesn't touch the admin interface.
        - Two buttons - new or returning member?
            - For new, if it finds a partial match, confirm that it is a new member
            - Else create a new member + membership
        - For returning: use DAL to find member name, update details, and create membership
    - DONE: (Members) Add expiry to roles like committee, and make those work
        - Add inherent permissions to roles. eg. Library Powers to Committee.
    - TODO: Make a cronjob to check for expired permissions each day

Library:
    - DONE: (Library) Add borrowing records, and a checkout system for logged in gatekeepers, tie in with memberDB
        - Make sure borrowable status is on item pages
        - TODO: Add a reservation form for events and external clubs, items aren't borrowable if reserved.
        - Add a "not-borrowable" flag
        - High-demand flag for borrowable items (sets the default due date)
    - TODO: (Library) Add player numbers to library items
        - Allow null values.
        - If both null, display nothing.
        - If max is null and min is X, display "X+ players".
        - If min is null and max is X, display "1 - X players."
        - If min is X and max is Y, display "X - Y players"
    - TODO: (Library) Add a item create/edit form outside of the admin interface
        - Make sure to check for proper permissions.
    - TODO: (Library) Maybe barcode field?
        - Just a text box that you can put in a barcode (enables librarian quicksearch mode)
        - No need to generate barcodes.
        - Possible that two items could share a barcode, make sure to account for that.
    - DONE: (Library) Make Tag non-mandatory

Content Management System:
    - TODO (CMS): Figure out how the hell to do this.

Future future ideas:
    - Calender + events system?
    - Blog?
    - Discord integration

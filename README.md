My effort to be immortalised in the form of the Unigames Website.

The goals:
- Provide a comprehensive library system for the club, that can handle all types of items in the club.
- Provide a membership database for the club, allowing the club to securely store the information of its members.
- Provide a system to more accurately track the state of the library, including borrowing by members and external entities.
- Provide an administration system so that the committee of the club can manage the website without having to have a reat deal of technical experience.
